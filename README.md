# haus-catalogue

NFT experiment for LucidHaus.

## Bundlr Uploader (hard coded to use matic on polygon)

In order to permenantly store the media of our NFTs, we opt for a decentralized solution for storage. Using arweave via bundlr - we can upload and recieve the `URI` of a media file @ https://haus-catalogue.vercel.app/upload
